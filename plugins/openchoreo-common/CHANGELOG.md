# @openchoreo/backstage-plugin-common

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 18e51cf: Add support for custom component-creation templates. A (Cluster)ComponentType
  can now set the `scaffolder.openchoreo.dev/backstage-template-url` annotation to
  point at a hand-authored Backstage scaffolder Template. When present, the catalog
  sync fetches that Template from the URL (via the configured `integrations`) and
  emits it in place of the auto-generated wizard; when absent, behaviour is
  unchanged. Applies to both the periodic and event-driven sync paths. If the URL
  cannot be read or does not yield a valid `kind: Template`, an error is logged and
  no template is emitted for that type.
- cf2203a: Add a pod-aware exec terminal in the Deploy view. The Terminal lives in the K8s resource-tree drawer reached via Deploy → environment → View K8s Artifacts: it appears as a tab on the Pod node's drawer (with a container picker) when the pod is rendered in the tree, and falls back to the ReleaseBinding drawer when the pod is managed by another operator and the binding is healthy. The exec session targets the selected pod and container via WebSocket. The standalone component-level Terminal tab has been removed.

  Access is gated by the `openchoreo.exec` permission with per-environment ABAC, and the `POST /exec/init` backend endpoint now enforces this permission server-side so direct API calls cannot bypass the UI gate.

- 383e7f6: Add Backstage management for OpenChoreo notification channels (email and webhook), the platform resource that alert rules send notifications to. Notification channels are now browsable and creatable from the catalog and /create pages alongside Environments and other platform resources, with dedicated create/read/update/delete permissions, a catalog relation to their target Environment, and a raw-definition editor.
- 284fcd7: Surface OpenChoreo controller auto-deploy failures in the Deploy tab. Pre-binding release-generation failures (bad trait, invalid config — from `Component.status.conditions`) now surface on the Setup card and as an error marker on the canvas Set-up tile, instead of leaving the user with no signal. Post-binding render/apply failures (from `ReleaseBinding.status.conditions`) show an actionable error banner with the controller's reason + message in the environment detail panel, instead of a context-free "Failed" badge. Long controller messages are clamped to a compact banner with a "View details" dialog (reason + full message + copy).

### Patch Changes

- 62608f5: chore: remove dead code left over from the OpenAPI-client and New Frontend
  System migrations — commented-out blocks, orphaned files/components, and unused
  deprecated exports (`LogEntry`/`RuntimeLogsResponse` aliases, `FILTER_PRESETS`,
  `useOrgName`, `useRCAReportByAlert`, `UserTypeConfig`), plus consolidation of
  duplicated backend response-type wrappers. No behavioural changes.
- 529f13c: add component events view and hooks
- 39d264c: Fix OAuth scopes in the auth code flow: inject configured scope into the passport-oauth2 token exchange and refresh, and expose the scope to the frontend client via `openchoreo.features.auth.scope` so sign-in and session refresh requests use the operator-configured scope instead of hardcoded defaults.
- 8416223: Add a per-ProjectType "Create Project" wizard, mirroring the Resource creation flow.

  Each `ProjectType` / `ClusterProjectType` now generates a scaffolder Template via `PtdToTemplateConverter`, surfaced under a new `?view=projects` browse view with a dedicated "Project" landing card. Selecting a type opens a wizard whose parameters step is driven by the type's `spec.parameters.openAPIV3Schema`, then creates the Project with `spec.type` and `spec.parameters` set via the extended `openchoreo:project:create` action (it falls back to the OpenChoreo API default when these are omitted, keeping the legacy path working). The catalog provider emits these templates during full sync and the event-delta path keeps them current. Replaces the static `create-openchoreo-project` template.

- 71f7b6c: Add a "Deploy" tab to the Project entity page for the project-release lifecycle.

  The tab renders the project's deployment pipeline as a DAG of environments with live status and drives deploy/promote through `ProjectRelease` / `ProjectReleaseBinding`. A "Set up" card opens a **Configure & Deploy** wizard: step 1 edits `Project.spec.parameters` against the `(Cluster)ProjectType` parameters schema (saving cuts a new `ProjectRelease`), step 2 pins the first environment's binding and edits its `environmentConfigs` overrides. Each environment node supports **Promote** (copy the pinned release forward to the next environment) and **Configure overrides**; all mutating actions gate on the project-update permission.

  Backed by new BFF endpoints (`/project-environment-info`, `/project-release-bindings`, `/update-project-release-binding`, `/project-release-schema`) and matching `OpenChoreoClient` methods.

- 2f45e83: Add Backstage catalog and UI support for the new OpenChoreo `ProjectType` (namespaced) and `ClusterProjectType` (cluster-scoped) platform-engineer abstractions introduced by the project-release-lifecycle epic.

  The catalog provider now ingests both kinds (full sync and near-real-time event deltas), translates them into dedicated entity kinds, and links each `Project` to the `ProjectType` / `ClusterProjectType` it references via `spec.type` (an `instanceOf` / `hasInstance` relation). Both kinds get first-class Overview pages — rendering their `parameters` / `environmentConfigs` schemas, `validations`, and `resources` templates — plus a Definition tab showing the raw CR, and they appear throughout the catalog UI (kind registry, icons, graph labels, About card).

  Permission wiring enables create / edit / delete on both kinds for authorized users, and a scaffolder creation wizard is added for each (grouped under "Platform Resources"). The generated OpenChoreo API client is re-synced from core `main` to pick up the `ProjectType` / `ClusterProjectType` schemas, their REST endpoints, and the new `Project.spec.type` field.

- 8d8bd80: Upgrade the OpenChoreo Backstage plugin suite to Backstage v1.51.0.

  This bump aligns every `@backstage/*` peer dependency with the v1.51.0 line and adapts the plugins to the API shapes introduced across v1.44–v1.51. Adopters running the OpenChoreo plugins on a host Backstage app must be on Backstage v1.51.0 (or newer) after this release; older host versions will hit peer-dep mismatches.

  Notable adapter-side changes:

  - Scaffolder backend actions now use the v4.0 `schema.input: { field: z => z.type(...) }` field-per-arrow shape introduced after v1.43.3.
  - Permission rules inline their `paramsSchema` at the `createPermissionRule` call site and import Zod via `zod/v3` to match what `@backstage/plugin-permission-node@0.11.0` was compiled against.
  - The catalog backend module reads `catalogProcessingExtensionPoint` from the stable export (no `/alpha`) and registers permission rules through `coreServices.permissionsRegistry`.
  - React 18 + Node 22 are required at runtime, in line with Backstage v1.50+.

- d19ffcf: Virtualize the log/event/trace/wirelog views with a new shared `VirtualizedLogList` primitive.

  **New shared primitive (`@openchoreo/backstage-plugin-react`)**

  `VirtualizedLogList` is a headless windowed list built on `@tanstack/react-virtual`. It handles row windowing, automatic variable/wrapped row-height measurement (via `measureElement`), follow-tail for live streams, scroll-driven load-more (`onReachEnd`), and exposes `header` / `footer` slots that render inside the scroll container so they share the rows' content width and stay aligned with the body cells.

  Alongside the primitive, three small hooks/utilities the consumers compose with:

  - `useRowExpansion()` — tracks expanded row keys in a Set lifted to the parent table, so per-row expansion survives the virtualizer unmounting off-screen rows.
  - `useAutoLoadWhenEmpty({ count, hasMore, loading, onLoadMore })` — fires `onLoadMore` once when the list is empty but the server reports more pages, restoring the IntersectionObserver-equivalent "auto-fetch when the sentinel is visible" behaviour now that there is no DOM sentinel. Re-arms on count transitions, doesn't loop on repeated empty responses.
  - `makeColumnStyle<K>(flexByKey)` — factory that builds the `getColumnStyle(key)` helper for the div-based tables. Memoizes style objects per key so cell renders return stable references.

  **Surfaces virtualized**

  - **Build Logs** (`openchoreo-ci` `LogsContent`) — per-step build log viewer with accordion sections. Single fetch per step plus periodic polling.
  - **Workflow Run Step Logs** (`openchoreo-workflows`) — generic workflow run step logs. Follow-tail pinned to the bottom while a step is running.
  - **Runtime Logs** (`openchoreo-observability` `LogsTable` / `LogEntry`) — multi-column observability runtime logs. Sticky multi-column header, severity chips, expand-on-click rows, copy/investigate actions, infinite scroll wired through `onReachEnd` + `useAutoLoadWhenEmpty` (replacing the previous IntersectionObserver sentinel). The Phase-1/2 a11y attributes (`scope="col"`, `role="status"`/`aria-busy`/`aria-hidden`) carry across to the new div-based markup as `role="table"`/`role="row"`/`role="columnheader"` and the load-more spinner.
  - **Runtime Events** (`openchoreo-observability` `EventsTable` / `EventEntry`) — same shape as Runtime Logs (multi-column, expand-on-click, infinite scroll).
  - **Wirelogs** (`openchoreo-observability` `WirelogsTable`) — Cilium flow stream viewer. The previous hand-rolled `stickToBottomRef` + `useLayoutEffect` is replaced by the primitive's `followTail`, which catches both append and same-length cap-shift / dedupe / replace-by-uuid updates via last-item-key tracking.
  - **Traces** (`openchoreo-observability` `TracesTable`) — project-level traces with expand-on-click `WaterfallView`. Click events inside the waterfall are isolated from the row toggle.

  **Shared workflow-status helpers (`@openchoreo/backstage-plugin-common`)**

  `isTerminalStatus(status)` and `isStepLive(step, parentStatus)` replace four near-identical inline copies across `BuildLogs`, `BuildEvents`, `WorkflowRunStepLogs`, `WorkflowRunEvents`, and `RunMetadataContent`. One source of truth, case-insensitive matching, structurally-typed `isStepLive` so it accepts any `{ phase?: string }`-shaped step.

  **Notable behavioural notes**

  - Long runs paint faster and scroll smoothly — only the viewport's worth of rows is mounted regardless of payload size.
  - Wrapped multi-line log entries no longer overlap (auto-measured by tanstack instead of the previous hand-rolled measurement on top of react-window v1).
  - Per-row expanded state survives scrolling off-screen and back.
  - Live streams (running step logs, wirelogs) stay pinned to the newest row while the user is at the bottom; the tail releases as soon as they scroll up.
  - Load-more recovers from a server response of `hasMore: true` with no new rows: the user can scroll away and back to the bottom to re-trigger.
