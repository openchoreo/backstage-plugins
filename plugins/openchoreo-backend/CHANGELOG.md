# @openchoreo/backstage-plugin-backend

## 1.2.0-next.3

### Minor Changes

- f126bca: Block deploying a component to an environment where its project is not deployed, and guide the user to deploy the project first.
- cf2203a: Add a pod-aware exec terminal in the Deploy view. The Terminal lives in the K8s resource-tree drawer reached via Deploy → environment → View K8s Artifacts: it appears as a tab on the Pod node's drawer (with a container picker) when the pod is rendered in the tree, and falls back to the ReleaseBinding drawer when the pod is managed by another operator and the binding is healthy. The exec session targets the selected pod and container via WebSocket. The standalone component-level Terminal tab has been removed.

  Access is gated by the `openchoreo.exec` permission with per-environment ABAC, and the `POST /exec/init` backend endpoint now enforces this permission server-side so direct API calls cannot bypass the UI gate.

- 383e7f6: Add Backstage management for OpenChoreo notification channels (email and webhook), the platform resource that alert rules send notifications to. Notification channels are now browsable and creatable from the catalog and /create pages alongside Environments and other platform resources, with dedicated create/read/update/delete permissions, a catalog relation to their target Environment, and a raw-definition editor.
- 284fcd7: Surface OpenChoreo controller auto-deploy failures in the Deploy tab. Pre-binding release-generation failures (bad trait, invalid config — from `Component.status.conditions`) now surface on the Setup card and as an error marker on the canvas Set-up tile, instead of leaving the user with no signal. Post-binding render/apply failures (from `ReleaseBinding.status.conditions`) show an actionable error banner with the controller's reason + message in the environment detail panel, instead of a context-free "Failed" badge. Long controller messages are clamped to a compact banner with a "View details" dialog (reason + full message + copy).
- 453b958: Show a "Suspended" status in the deployment pipeline when a component's workload is scaled to zero. The backend reads the suspended state that core already reports on the ReleaseBinding's ResourcesReady condition, and the pipeline badge now shows "Suspended" instead of "Active" for a scaled-to-zero workload.

### Patch Changes

- 436c144: Bring the Cell Diagram library into the repo as the internal package
  `@openchoreo/cell-diagram` (previously the external `@wso2/cell-diagram`). The
  exported API is unchanged; the frontend and backend plugins now consume the
  workspace package.
- 62608f5: chore: remove dead code left over from the OpenAPI-client and New Frontend
  System migrations — commented-out blocks, orphaned files/components, and unused
  deprecated exports (`LogEntry`/`RuntimeLogsResponse` aliases, `FILTER_PRESETS`,
  `useOrgName`, `useRCAReportByAlert`, `UserTypeConfig`), plus consolidation of
  duplicated backend response-type wrappers. No behavioural changes.
- f1163a9: Fix the Deploy views defaulting to every environment in the namespace when a project's deployment pipeline defines no environments. A resolved pipeline with no promotion paths now yields no environments (the UI shows its empty state), and a pipeline that cannot be resolved (missing `deploymentPipelineRef` or a failed pipeline fetch) surfaces an error state instead of silently listing all environments.

  A permission denial on the deployment-pipeline read (`deploymentpipelines:view`) now surfaces as a Forbidden state instead of a misleading "pipeline missing/misconfigured" error.

  The Component, Project, and Resource Deploy tabs now share the same empty-state and error-state cards (icon, message, and Retry) with consistent, pipeline-focused copy, replacing the plain text lines previously shown on the Project and Resource tabs.

- 6b82eae: Update stale code comments that referenced the exec WebSocket proxy's old location (`packages/backend/src/index.ts`); it now lives in and is registered from the `@openchoreo/backstage-plugin-backend` plugin.
- d5eff9e: Replace the generic "No environments found. Make sure your component is properly configured." message on the observability pages (Runtime Logs, Runtime Events, Alerts, Wirelogs, Metrics, Traces, Incidents, Cost Analysis, RCA — component and project scoped) with cause-specific messaging. `useProjectEnvironments` now reports a discriminated status — `empty-pipeline` (the deployment pipeline has no environments), `forbidden` (permission to view the pipeline is denied), or `unavailable` (the pipeline is missing or couldn't be loaded) — and the pages render a cause-specific state via a shared `EnvironmentsStatusNotice` component, using the standard Backstage `EmptyState` (matching the Deploy tab). A missing `deploymentPipelineRef` now returns a clean 404 instead of a 500.
- 14f1052: Add a default-on Auto Deploy toggle to the project creation wizard. When on, `openchoreo:project:create` creates one unpinned ProjectReleaseBinding per deployment-pipeline environment after the project is created, and the control plane seeds the release pin once the first release is cut. Toggling it off shows a warning that the project must be deployed manually from its Deploy tab before components can be deployed. The Deploy tab now shows just-created unpinned bindings (`ProjectReleaseNotSet`) as pending instead of failed.
- 71f7b6c: Add a "Deploy" tab to the Project entity page for the project-release lifecycle.

  The tab renders the project's deployment pipeline as a DAG of environments with live status and drives deploy/promote through `ProjectRelease` / `ProjectReleaseBinding`. A "Set up" card opens a **Configure & Deploy** wizard: step 1 edits `Project.spec.parameters` against the `(Cluster)ProjectType` parameters schema (saving cuts a new `ProjectRelease`), step 2 pins the first environment's binding and edits its `environmentConfigs` overrides. Each environment node supports **Promote** (copy the pinned release forward to the next environment) and **Configure overrides**; all mutating actions gate on the project-update permission.

  Backed by new BFF endpoints (`/project-environment-info`, `/project-release-bindings`, `/update-project-release-binding`, `/project-release-schema`) and matching `OpenChoreoClient` methods.

- 2f45e83: Add Backstage catalog and UI support for the new OpenChoreo `ProjectType` (namespaced) and `ClusterProjectType` (cluster-scoped) platform-engineer abstractions introduced by the project-release-lifecycle epic.

  The catalog provider now ingests both kinds (full sync and near-real-time event deltas), translates them into dedicated entity kinds, and links each `Project` to the `ProjectType` / `ClusterProjectType` it references via `spec.type` (an `instanceOf` / `hasInstance` relation). Both kinds get first-class Overview pages — rendering their `parameters` / `environmentConfigs` schemas, `validations`, and `resources` templates — plus a Definition tab showing the raw CR, and they appear throughout the catalog UI (kind registry, icons, graph labels, About card).

  Permission wiring enables create / edit / delete on both kinds for authorized users, and a scaffolder creation wizard is added for each (grouped under "Platform Resources"). The generated OpenChoreo API client is re-synced from core `main` to pick up the `ProjectType` / `ClusterProjectType` schemas, their REST endpoints, and the new `Project.spec.type` field.

- 5741d00: Limit how long a wirelogs stream can run. Wirelogs (Cilium Hubble flows) previously streamed indefinitely — there's no upstream timeout, so a forgotten tab could hold an open SSE connection for hours and degrade the browser.

  The backend `/wirelogs/stream` proxy now enforces a hard cap (default 15 minutes, configurable via `openchoreo.observability.wirelogs.streamTimeoutSeconds`): it advertises the cap to the client in a `meta` SSE frame and, on hitting it, sends a `timeout` frame before closing so the UI can label the stop precisely. The wirelogs view layers graduated soft warnings over this — confirmation dialogs at roughly one-third and two-thirds of the cap let the user stop early or knowingly continue, and a toast explains when the server ends the stream (the Start button resumes a fresh session).
