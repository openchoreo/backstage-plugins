# @openchoreo/backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module

## 1.2.0-next.0

### Patch Changes

- ffa762f: Fix stale form data in the component-creation Build & Deploy section.
  Generated templates now nest deploymentSource and its branch-specific
  fields (workflow_name, git_source, workflow_parameters, containerImage,
  autoDeploy, ciPlatform, ciIdentifier) under a single buildAndDeploy
  object rendered by a composite field, so switching deployment source
  clears the previous branch's data atomically — fixes
  "instance.workflow requires property \"name\"" when a user picks Build
  from Source and then switches to Container Image or External CI.
- 8d8bd80: Upgrade the OpenChoreo Backstage plugin suite to Backstage v1.51.0.

  This bump aligns every `@backstage/*` peer dependency with the v1.51.0 line and adapts the plugins to the API shapes introduced across v1.44–v1.51. Adopters running the OpenChoreo plugins on a host Backstage app must be on Backstage v1.51.0 (or newer) after this release; older host versions will hit peer-dep mismatches.

  Notable adapter-side changes:

  - Scaffolder backend actions now use the v4.0 `schema.input: { field: z => z.type(...) }` field-per-arrow shape introduced after v1.43.3.
  - Permission rules inline their `paramsSchema` at the `createPermissionRule` call site and import Zod via `zod/v3` to match what `@backstage/plugin-permission-node@0.11.0` was compiled against.
  - The catalog backend module reads `catalogProcessingExtensionPoint` from the stable export (no `/alpha`) and registers permission rules through `coreServices.permissionsRegistry`.
  - React 18 + Node 22 are required at runtime, in line with Backstage v1.50+.
