# @openchoreo/backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module

## 2.0.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- acc4c81: Make both packages work under Backstage backend feature discovery
  (`backend.add(discoveryFeatureLoader)`), which reads a package's **default**
  export only.

  `@openchoreo/backstage-plugin-auth-backend-module-openchoreo-auth` had no
  default export at all — `OpenChoreoAuthModule` was reachable as a named export
  alone, which is why the install guide adds it with
  `backend.add(OpenChoreoAuthModule)` while every sibling package uses a dynamic
  import. It is now also the default export.

  `@openchoreo/backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module` exported the catalog
  module as its default, but `immediateCatalogServiceFactory` and
  `annotationStoreFactory` were named exports, so discovery installed the module
  without the two services it and `@openchoreo/backstage-plugin-backend` depend
  on. The default export is now a backend feature loader yielding all three.

  Existing explicit wiring is unaffected. A service factory installed explicitly
  with `backend.add(...)` takes precedence over one offered by a feature loader,
  and the loader's copy is ignored rather than colliding.

- cdc4c6e: Support components with release lines.

  - Every component has an implicit `main` line, built from the component's own workload and bindings. Its other lines are ReleaseLine resources, synced to the catalog as a new `ReleaseLine` kind, part of their component and visible to whoever can view the component. They are not listed in the catalog viewer or search, and are reached from their component's Overview.
  - Components are created as before. Any component's context menu offers Create Release Line. Once a component has a release line, its Overview lists its lines, `main` first, with their environments, latest release and overrides. The component's own tabs work on the main line, which can't be edited, deleted or created. The names `main` and `default` are rejected for a new line: `main` is the implicit line, and `default` is reserved.
  - Each release line has its own page with the component's tabs (build, deploy, logs, metrics, ...) scoped to that line. Its Definition tab edits the properties the line overrides, next to the properties it inherits from the component, which are read-only and edited on the component's Definition page.
  - The `main` keyword is never written into a resource or request: releases, deploys, workload saves, dependencies and builds for the main line leave the release line empty. A dependency on a component with release lines picks the main line or one of its release lines, the main line unless chosen otherwise.
  - The project cell diagram shows the main line and each release line of a component as their own nodes, labelled with the component name and a pill with the line name, with a Release line filter. Dependencies link to the line they name, or to the main line, and gateway metrics are scoped per line. Clicking a line node opens the line's page.
  - Runtime logs, events, metrics, alerts, project logs, metrics, traces and incidents, cost insights and cost analysis reports get a Release line filter of All lines, `main` or one line, shown for a component with release lines. On a release line's page they are scoped to the line. Alert and incident details show the release line when there is one, and the observability API reports clearly when the installed FinOps module cannot filter costs by line.
  - The Delivery Insights page shows a Release line filter when the selected component has release lines, narrowing the metrics and the per-environment breakdown to `main` or one line.
  - An RCA report's Incident Overview shows the release line the alert fired on.
  - Cost analysis reports show their line in their overview and in the reports list, and link to the line's page and metrics, or the component's for the main line. Apply Recommendation names the release binding it updates and refuses a binding that belongs to another line.
  - Cost Insights applies a recommendation to the binding of the selected release line, and refuses a binding of another line. For a component with release lines, Apply is disabled until a line is chosen, since a recommendation for all lines matches no single binding.
  - Workflow runs returned by the workflows backend include their labels, so a run can be matched to its release line.
  - The environment overview lists each release line deployed in an environment as its own row, linked to the line's page, and Recent Deployments shows release lines next to components. `GET /release-bindings` returns the main line's bindings without a line, and every line's with `allReleaseLines=true`.
  - The unused `promoteToEnvironment` client method and the backend `/promote-deployment` route are removed. The OpenChoreo API no longer has the promote endpoint they called, and the Promote action deploys through the release binding instead.
  - A new release line's Workload and bindings are named as OpenChoreo names a line's objects, `{component}-{line}-{hash}`, so they never take a name another component needs. Deploy, promote, saving overrides and removing a deployment find a line's binding by its owner (component, line and environment) rather than by name, since a binding created elsewhere may be named otherwise.

  Components without release lines behave as before.

## 1.3.0

### Patch Changes

- 67ba0da: Refresh the parent System when a component is removed so its now-dangling
  `hasPart` relation is dropped. Without this, deleting a component left the
  project page showing "Some related entities could not be found in the catalog"
  until the catalog was rebuilt, because the System's relations are only
  recomputed when it is re-processed and the periodic full sync re-emits it
  unchanged.
- 9eb3d31: Register the Jenkins frontend plugin so the build-status card and tab work.
  `EntityLatestJenkinsRunCard` and `EntityJenkinsContent` are entity cards and
  tabs rather than routes, so `convertLegacyAppRoot` never discovered the plugin
  and `jenkinsApiRef` had no factory — the entity page threw
  `NotImplementedError: No implementation available for apiRef{plugin.jenkins.service2}`.
  Same fix already applied for api-docs and kubernetes.

  Also clarifies the scaffolder's CI identifier field: it takes a Jenkins job
  **full name** (`my-folder/my-job`), not a `/job/...` URL path. The plugin adds
  the `/job/` segments itself, so a URL-style value resolves to a folder literally
  named `job` and 404s.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 18e51cf: Add support for custom component-creation templates. A (Cluster)ComponentType
  can now set the `scaffolder.openchoreo.dev/backstage-template-url` annotation to
  point at a hand-authored Backstage scaffolder Template. When present, the catalog
  sync fetches that Template from the URL (via the configured `integrations`) and
  emits it in place of the auto-generated wizard; when absent, behaviour is
  unchanged. Applies to both the periodic and event-driven sync paths. If the URL
  cannot be read or does not yield a valid `kind: Template`, an error is logged and
  no template is emitted for that type.
- 383e7f6: Add Backstage management for OpenChoreo notification channels (email and webhook), the platform resource that alert rules send notifications to. Notification channels are now browsable and creatable from the catalog and /create pages alongside Environments and other platform resources, with dedicated create/read/update/delete permissions, a catalog relation to their target Environment, and a raw-definition editor.
- 14f1052: Add a default-on Auto Deploy toggle to the project creation wizard. When on, `openchoreo:project:create` creates one unpinned ProjectReleaseBinding per deployment-pipeline environment after the project is created, and the control plane seeds the release pin once the first release is cut. Toggling it off shows a warning that the project must be deployed manually from its Deploy tab before components can be deployed. The Deploy tab now shows just-created unpinned bindings (`ProjectReleaseNotSet`) as pending instead of failed.

### Patch Changes

- ffa762f: Fix stale form data in the component-creation Build & Deploy section.
  Generated templates now nest deploymentSource and its branch-specific
  fields (workflow_name, git_source, workflow_parameters, containerImage,
  autoDeploy, ciPlatform, ciIdentifier) under a single buildAndDeploy
  object rendered by a composite field, so switching deployment source
  clears the previous branch's data atomically — fixes
  "instance.workflow requires property \"name\"" when a user picks Build
  from Source and then switches to Container Image or External CI.
- 8416223: Add a per-ProjectType "Create Project" wizard, mirroring the Resource creation flow.

  Each `ProjectType` / `ClusterProjectType` now generates a scaffolder Template via `PtdToTemplateConverter`, surfaced under a new `?view=projects` browse view with a dedicated "Project" landing card. Selecting a type opens a wizard whose parameters step is driven by the type's `spec.parameters.openAPIV3Schema`, then creates the Project with `spec.type` and `spec.parameters` set via the extended `openchoreo:project:create` action (it falls back to the OpenChoreo API default when these are omitted, keeping the legacy path working). The catalog provider emits these templates during full sync and the event-delta path keeps them current. Replaces the static `create-openchoreo-project` template.

- 2f45e83: Add Backstage catalog and UI support for the new OpenChoreo `ProjectType` (namespaced) and `ClusterProjectType` (cluster-scoped) platform-engineer abstractions introduced by the project-release-lifecycle epic.

  The catalog provider now ingests both kinds (full sync and near-real-time event deltas), translates them into dedicated entity kinds, and links each `Project` to the `ProjectType` / `ClusterProjectType` it references via `spec.type` (an `instanceOf` / `hasInstance` relation). Both kinds get first-class Overview pages — rendering their `parameters` / `environmentConfigs` schemas, `validations`, and `resources` templates — plus a Definition tab showing the raw CR, and they appear throughout the catalog UI (kind registry, icons, graph labels, About card).

  Permission wiring enables create / edit / delete on both kinds for authorized users, and a scaffolder creation wizard is added for each (grouped under "Platform Resources"). The generated OpenChoreo API client is re-synced from core `main` to pick up the `ProjectType` / `ClusterProjectType` schemas, their REST endpoints, and the new `Project.spec.type` field.

- 8d8bd80: Upgrade the OpenChoreo Backstage plugin suite to Backstage v1.51.0.

  This bump aligns every `@backstage/*` peer dependency with the v1.51.0 line and adapts the plugins to the API shapes introduced across v1.44–v1.51. Adopters running the OpenChoreo plugins on a host Backstage app must be on Backstage v1.51.0 (or newer) after this release; older host versions will hit peer-dep mismatches.

  Notable adapter-side changes:

  - Scaffolder backend actions now use the v4.0 `schema.input: { field: z => z.type(...) }` field-per-arrow shape introduced after v1.43.3.
  - Permission rules inline their `paramsSchema` at the `createPermissionRule` call site and import Zod via `zod/v3` to match what `@backstage/plugin-permission-node@0.11.0` was compiled against.
  - The catalog backend module reads `catalogProcessingExtensionPoint` from the stable export (no `/alpha`) and registers permission rules through `coreServices.permissionsRegistry`.
  - React 18 + Node 22 are required at runtime, in line with Backstage v1.50+.
