Add a "Deploy" tab to the Project entity page for the project-release lifecycle.

The tab renders the project's deployment pipeline as a DAG of environments with live status and drives deploy/promote through `ProjectRelease` / `ProjectReleaseBinding`. A "Set up" card opens a **Configure & Deploy** wizard: step 1 edits `Project.spec.parameters` against the `(Cluster)ProjectType` parameters schema (saving cuts a new `ProjectRelease`), step 2 pins the first environment's binding and edits its `environmentConfigs` overrides. Each environment node supports **Promote** (copy the pinned release forward to the next environment) and **Configure overrides**; all mutating actions gate on the project-update permission.

Backed by new BFF endpoints (`/project-environment-info`, `/project-release-bindings`, `/update-project-release-binding`, `/project-release-schema`) and matching `OpenChoreoClient` methods.
