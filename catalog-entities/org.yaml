# Placeholder Group entities for Backstage catalog owner references
#
# These groups exist to satisfy Backstage's schema validation for built-in
# entity kinds (Domain, System, Component, API, Template) which require
# an owner field that references an existing Group entity.
#
# OpenChoreo uses an entitlement-based RBAC model where authorization is
# determined by user types and role-entitlement mappings, not entity ownership.
# These placeholder groups are purely for Backstage compatibility.
